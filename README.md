Console Notepad

I've just started learning the Python language. And for a long time I thought about what kind of project to write, though not a big one, but my own. 
When you write your own project, you are faced with tasks that need to be solved, so you learn the language deeper. 
That's why I decided to try to write a console notepad. 
This is just the beginning. Gradually I'm going to add new functions and adjust something. 
At the same time, publishing projects here, I study Git and GitHub. 
In general, I like console applications.
